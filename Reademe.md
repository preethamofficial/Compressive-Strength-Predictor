## Overview

This project aims to predict the compressive strength of concrete using machine learning. Users can input relevant features via a web frontend, and receive strength predictions.  

---

## Features

- Interactive web UI to enter feature values  
- Backend model serving predictions  
- Persistent storage if needed (for example, saving inputs or logs)  
- Clean separation of frontend and backend  

---

## Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Backend / API | Django (Python) |
| Frontend | React (JavaScript) |
| ML Model | Scikit‐learn / any chosen regression algorithm |
| Data Format | CSV / Pandas etc. |
| Other | REST API, possibly deployment tools (Docker, etc.) |

## Overall Process / Workflow

1. **Data gathering**: collect a dataset of concrete with features (e.g. cement content, water content, age, etc.) and target variable: compressive strength.  
2. **Data preprocessing**: clean data, handle missing values, scale/normalize features, split into training & test sets.  
3. **Model training**: train regression model(s) (e.g. Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.), validate performance (e.g. R², MAE, MSE).  
4. **Save the trained model** (pickle / joblib) for later inference.  
5. **Backend setup**: create Django project that loads the trained model. Expose an API endpoint (e.g. `/predict`) which takes feature inputs (JSON form) and returns predicted strength.  
6. **Frontend setup**: React UI to take user inputs via forms, send requests to backend API, display predicted compressive strength.  
7. **Integration**: connect frontend and backend. Ensure correct CORS setup, error handling.  
8. **Testing**: test with sample inputs, check robustness.  
9. **Deployment**: host the backend + model (e.g. Heroku, AWS, GCP) and the frontend (Netlify / Vercel / same server).
